"""Per-shop semantic layer written by the LLM (no hand-written role/keyword rules).

The model reads one shop's README + SCHEMA + RULEBOOK and writes ONE SELECT that maps the raw tables to fixed
line-level columns. Generic SQL below casts them, lifts cancel/return flags to the whole order (rulebook: an order
with any cancelled/returned line is excluded as a whole) and derives v_sales / v_orders (valid only) plus *_all
variants. All samples are executed. The most common result fingerprint wins (execution-based self-consistency).

VIEW_SYSTEM = """You map ONE shop's raw tables (DuckDB) to a canonical sales table. Read README, SCHEMA and RULEBOOK carefully: they say which table holds the sales, which column is the order id, the date, the quantity, the line amount, the status.
Write ONE read-only DuckDB SELECT (WITH allowed) returning one row per sold line (one row per order or ticket if the shop records no lines), with exactly these columns:
  order_id      the order / invoice / ticket id (all lines of one order share it; one id = one order in the whole data: when the id is a running number that restarts per day/sheet/file, combine it with the date, e.g. strftime(date, '%Y%m%d') || '-' || id)
  order_date    DATE the order was placed (rulebook: the order date decides the period)
  order_ts      TIMESTAMP of the order, NULL if no time of day is recorded
  product_code  item code of the line, NULL if none
  product_group product group / category of the item (nhóm hàng, loại, danh mục) from the line or the catalog, NULL if none
  product_name  item / service name of the line (full name from a product catalog when the line only has a code or abbreviation), NULL if none
  qty           quantity sold on the line in the item's BASE UNIT (đơn vị cơ bản): a column already holding the converted quantity if the line table has one, otherwise the recorded quantity times the factor for the line's unit from the conversion table, catalog or README; an item with one unit keeps the recorded quantity
  unit          base unit of qty, NULL if none
  amount        line revenue in VND after line-level discounts, before order-level vouchers, without VAT/shipping
  customer_id   customer code / member card id when the shop records one (mã khách, mã thẻ ...), NULL otherwise and for walk-ins
  customer_name customer name; NULL for walk-in customers (khách lẻ, kl, lẻ, vãng lai, blank), matched in any case/spacing: lower(trim(x)) IN ('khách lẻ', ...)
  staff, channel, payment   NULL when the shop does not record them
  is_cancelled  BOOLEAN, this line/order is cancelled per the rulebook (hủy/huỷ, không giao được ...)
  is_returned   BOOLEAN, this line/order is returned per the rulebook (trả hàng, đổi trả, hoàn, khách trả lại ..., also partial)
  line_kind     'item' (goods), 'service' (a fee line the rulebook counts in revenue, e.g. labour, service charge / phí phục vụ) or 'adjust' (voucher, points, discount line, shipping fee and other lines the rulebook keeps out of revenue); decide each fee by the rulebook, not by its name
Rules: use only tables/columns listed in SCHEMA, always double-quoted. Join header and line tables only on the order id. Join a catalog on every way a line can name the item, since one book often mixes them: its code or abbreviation, and its full name, compared as lower(trim(regexp_replace(x, '\\s+', ' ', 'g'))), never duplicating lines, and keep the line's own name/code when the catalog has no match: coalesce(catalog name, line name). A name written with a placeholder in the README ('Dùng <n> điểm') is a pattern: match it with LIKE ('Dùng % điểm'), never literally. Read status from the status column, or from a note column when there is none; check every listed status VALUE and classify each one. Keep every row: do NOT filter out cancelled, returned or adjust lines; flag them. If the amount is not stored, compute it (qty * unit price - line discount).
Think briefly, then answer with the SQL in one ```sql``` block."""
