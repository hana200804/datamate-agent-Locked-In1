"""The inference pipeline, stage by stage.

    questions -> shops (loaded into DuckDB while the model starts)
              -> per shop, once: canonical sales views (views.py) and a debt layer (debts.py), drafted by the model and tested
                 on the data, or reused from a saved run (--views-from)
              -> per question: K plain SQL samples over two prompts, executed, failed ones repaired. Thinking samples for
                 low-agreement and debt questions. Majority vote, answer or abstain (voting.py)

Pipeline holds the run's settings and state. Each stage is one method, so a stage can run without the model (setup_shop and
build_chats only read the data, which is how tests/replays rebuild the exact prompts of a saved run).
